# d2l PyTorch
This repo is used as the notebook during my learning experience of 
PyTorch and code in deep learning

The content in the repo is divided into three parts:
- d2l: code in the book [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) and some practice programming by myself
- GNN: code to build up different types of GNNs, which lacks in the book d2l
- KG: code to construct *Knowledge Graph*

**Star or Fork this program if you like it**
